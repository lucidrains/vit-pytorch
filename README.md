## Vision Transformer - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch. Significance is further explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4">Yannic Kilcher's</a> video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.

For a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">here</a>.

The official Jax repository is <a href="https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer">here</a>.

## Distillation

<img src="./images/distill.png" width="300px"></img>

A recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877">paper</a> has shown that use of a distillation token for distilling knowledge from convolutional nets to vision transformer can yield small and efficient vision transformers. This repository offers the means to do distillation easily.

ex. distilling from Resnet50 (or any teacher) to a vision transformer

```python
import torch
from torchvision.models import resnet50

from vit_pytorch.distill import DistillableViT, DistillWrapper

teacher = resnet50(pretrained = True)

v = DistillableViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

distiller = DistillWrapper(
    student = v,
    teacher = teacher,
    temperature = 3,           # temperature of distillation
    alpha = 0.5,               # trade between main loss and distillation loss
    hard = False               # whether to use soft or hard distillation
)

img = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)
labels = torch.randint(0, 1000, (2,))

loss = distiller(img, labels)
loss.backward()

# after lots of training above ...

pred = v(img) # (2, 1000)
```

The `DistillableViT` class is identical to `ViT` except for how the forward pass is handled, so you should be able to load the parameters back to `ViT` after you have completed distillation training.

You can also use the handy `.to_vit` method on the `DistillableViT` instance to get back a `ViT` instance.

```python
v = v.to_vit()
type(v) # <class 'vit_pytorch.vit_pytorch.ViT'>
```

## Deep ViT

This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11886">paper</a> notes that ViT struggles to attend at greater depths (past 12 layers), and suggests mixing the attention of each head post-softmax as a solution, dubbed Re-attention. The results line up with the <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#talking-heads-attention">Talking Heads</a> paper from NLP.

You can use it as follows

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.deepvit import DeepViT

v = DeepViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## CaiT

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239">This paper</a> also notes difficulty in training vision transformers at greater depths and proposes two solutions. First it proposes to do per-channel multiplication of the output of the residual block. Second, it proposes to have the patches attend to one another, and only allow the CLS token to attend to the patches in the last few layers.

They also add <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#talking-heads-attention">Talking Heads</a>, noting improvements

You can use this scheme as follows

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.cait import CaiT

v = CaiT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 12,             # depth of transformer for patch to patch attention only
    cls_depth = 2,          # depth of cross attention of CLS tokens to patch
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1,
    layer_dropout = 0.05    # randomly dropout 5% of the layers
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Token-to-Token ViT

<img src="./images/t2t.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986">This paper</a> proposes that the first couple layers should downsample the image sequence by unfolding, leading to overlapping image data in each token as shown in the figure above. You can use this variant of the `ViT` as follows.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.t2t import T2TViT

v = T2TViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 224,
    depth = 5,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 512,
    num_classes = 1000,
    t2t_layers = ((7, 4), (3, 2), (3, 2)) # tuples of the kernel size and stride of each consecutive layers of the initial token to token module
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Cross ViT

<img src="./images/cross_vit.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14899">This paper</a> proposes to have two vision transformers processing the image at different scales, cross attending to one every so often. They show improvements on top of the base vision transformer.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.cross_vit import CrossViT

v = CrossViT(
    image_size = 256,
    num_classes = 1000,
    depth = 4,               # number of multi-scale encoding blocks
    sm_dim = 192,            # high res dimension
    sm_patch_size = 16,      # high res patch size (should be smaller than lg_patch_size)
    sm_enc_depth = 2,        # high res depth
    sm_enc_heads = 8,        # high res heads
    sm_enc_mlp_dim = 2048,   # high res feedforward dimension
    lg_dim = 384,            # low res dimension
    lg_patch_size = 64,      # low res patch size
    lg_enc_depth = 3,        # low res depth
    lg_enc_heads = 8,        # low res heads
    lg_enc_mlp_dim = 2048,   # low res feedforward dimensions
    cross_attn_depth = 2,    # cross attention rounds
    cross_attn_heads = 8,    # cross attention heads
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

pred = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## PiT

<img src="./images/pit.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16302">This paper</a> proposes to downsample the tokens through a pooling procedure using depth-wise convolutions.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.pit import PiT

v = PiT(
    image_size = 224,
    patch_size = 14,
    dim = 256,
    num_classes = 1000,
    depth = (3, 3, 3),     # list of depths, indicating the number of rounds of each stage before a downsample
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

# forward pass now returns predictions and the attention maps

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## LeViT

<img src="./images/levit.png" width="300px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01136">This paper</a> proposes a number of changes, including (1) convolutional embedding instead of patch-wise projection (2) downsampling in stages (3) extra non-linearity in attention (4) 2d relative positional biases instead of initial absolute positional bias (5) batchnorm in place of layernorm.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.levit import LeViT

levit = LeViT(
    image_size = 224,
    num_classes = 1000,
    stages = 3,             # number of stages
    dim = (256, 384, 512),  # dimensions at each stage
    depth = 4,              # transformer of depth 4 at each stage
    heads = (4, 6, 8),      # heads at each stage
    mlp_mult = 2,
    dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

levit(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## CvT

<img src="./images/cvt.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15808">This paper</a> proposes mixing convolutions and attention. Specifically, convolutions are used to embed and downsample the image / feature map in three stages. Depthwise-convoltion is also used to project the queries, keys, and values for attention.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.cvt import CvT

v = CvT(
    num_classes = 1000,
    s1_emb_dim = 64,        # stage 1 - dimension
    s1_emb_kernel = 7,      # stage 1 - conv kernel
    s1_emb_stride = 4,      # stage 1 - conv stride
    s1_proj_kernel = 3,     # stage 1 - attention ds-conv kernel size
    s1_kv_proj_stride = 2,  # stage 1 - attention key / value projection stride
    s1_heads = 1,           # stage 1 - heads
    s1_depth = 1,           # stage 1 - depth
    s1_mlp_mult = 4,        # stage 1 - feedforward expansion factor
    s2_emb_dim = 192,       # stage 2 - (same as above)
    s2_emb_kernel = 3,
    s2_emb_stride = 2,
    s2_proj_kernel = 3,
    s2_kv_proj_stride = 2,
    s2_heads = 3,
    s2_depth = 2,
    s2_mlp_mult = 4,
    s3_emb_dim = 384,       # stage 3 - (same as above)
    s3_emb_kernel = 3,
    s3_emb_stride = 2,
    s3_proj_kernel = 3,
    s3_kv_proj_stride = 2,
    s3_heads = 4,
    s3_depth = 10,
    s3_mlp_mult = 4,
    dropout = 0.
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

pred = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Masked Patch Prediction

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zankner">Zach</a>, you can train using the original masked patch prediction task presented in the paper, with the following code.

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT
from vit_pytorch.mpp import MPP

model = ViT(
    image_size=256,
    patch_size=32,
    num_classes=1000,
    dim=1024,
    depth=6,
    heads=8,
    mlp_dim=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    emb_dropout=0.1
)

mpp_trainer = MPP(
    transformer=model,
    patch_size=32,
    dim=1024,
    mask_prob=0.15,          # probability of using token in masked prediction task
    random_patch_prob=0.30,  # probability of randomly replacing a token being used for mpp
    replace_prob=0.50,       # probability of replacing a token being used for mpp with the mask token
)

opt = torch.optim.Adam(mpp_trainer.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

def sample_unlabelled_images():
    return torch.randn(20, 3, 256, 256)

for _ in range(100):
    images = sample_unlabelled_images()
    loss = mpp_trainer(images)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()

# save your improved network
torch.save(model.state_dict(), './pretrained-net.pt')
```

## Accessing Attention

If you would like to visualize the attention weights (post-softmax) for your research, just follow the procedure below

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.vit import ViT

v = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

# import Recorder and wrap the ViT

from vit_pytorch.recorder import Recorder
v = Recorder(v)

# forward pass now returns predictions and the attention maps

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
preds, attns = v(img)

# there is one extra patch due to the CLS token

attns # (1, 6, 16, 65, 65) - (batch x layers x heads x patch x patch)
```

to cleanup the class and the hooks once you have collected enough data

```python
v = v.eject()  # wrapper is discarded and original ViT instance is returned
```

## Research Ideas

### Self Supervised Training

You can train this with a near SOTA self-supervised learning technique, <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/byol-pytorch">BYOL</a>, with the following code.

(1)
```bash
$ pip install byol-pytorch
```

(2)
```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT
from byol_pytorch import BYOL

model = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    mlp_dim = 2048
)

learner = BYOL(
    model,
    image_size = 256,
    hidden_layer = 'to_latent'
)

opt = torch.optim.Adam(learner.parameters(), lr=3e-4)

def sample_unlabelled_images():
    return torch.randn(20, 3, 256, 256)

for _ in range(100):
    images = sample_unlabelled_images()
    loss = learner(images)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()
    learner.update_moving_average() # update moving average of target encoder

# save your improved network
torch.save(model.state_dict(), './pretrained-net.pt')
```

A pytorch-lightning script is ready for you to use at the repository link above.

### Efficient Attention

There may be some coming from computer vision who think attention still suffers from quadratic costs. Fortunately, we have a lot of new techniques that may help. This repository offers a way for you to plugin your own sparse attention transformer.

An example with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902">Nystromformer</a>

```bash
$ pip install nystrom-attention
```

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT
from nystrom_attention import Nystromformer

efficient_transformer = Nystromformer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    heads = 8,
    num_landmarks = 256
)

v = ViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 2048,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    transformer = efficient_transformer
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 2048, 2048) # your high resolution picture
v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

Other sparse attention frameworks I would highly recommend is <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/routing-transformer">Routing Transformer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/sinkhorn-transformer">Sinkhorn Transformer</a>

### Combining with other Transformer improvements

This paper purposely used the most vanilla of attention networks to make a statement. If you would like to use some of the latest improvements for attention nets, please use the `Encoder` from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers">this repository</a>.

ex.

```bash
$ pip install x-transformers
```

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT
from x_transformers import Encoder

v = ViT(
    dim = 512,
    image_size = 224,
    patch_size = 16,
    num_classes = 1000,
    transformer = Encoder(
        dim = 512,                  # set to be the same as the wrapper
        depth = 12,
        heads = 8,
        ff_glu = True,              # ex. feed forward GLU variant https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202
        residual_attn = True        # ex. residual attention https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11747
    )
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
v(img) # (1, 1000)
```
